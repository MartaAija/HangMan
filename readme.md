# Hangman Game

## Introduction
Welcome to Hangman Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game where the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player loses the game if they make six wrong guesses.

## Installation
To install and run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/<username>/hangman-game.git
2. Change into the project directory:
cd hangman-game
3. Install the required dependencies:
npm install
4. Start the app:
npm start
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

## Rules 
The game starts with a word chosen randomly from a predefined list of words.
The player has to guess the word by suggesting letters one by one.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The player loses the game if they "hang" the man.
The player wins the game if they guess all the letters in the word before they "hang" the man. 
#### Note that you need to press the letter again once you have the word correct!

## Enjoy the game!
